## This is customized awesome config from [titus-awesome](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/titus-awesome) 

### If you are looking for some information I encourage you to read [this](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/titus-awesome) 

#### All shortcuts and command are simmilar except those:

super+o -> move window to next screen
super+h/l -> switch between screens

#### I also changed some applications and commands for my needs. You can do it too if you want. This config is not that hard to customize.

## Installation

####This is one command to install. If you want to do it step by step I broke it down down below

`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y awesome i3lock xclip flameshot xfce4-power-manager && git clone https://github.com/Grandkahuna43325/Awesome_config ~/.config/awesome --depth 1 &&  wget -qO- https://git.io/papirus-icon-theme-install | sh`

To install awesome paste this command:
`sudo apt-get install awesome`

Paste this command to install dependencies:

`sudo apt-get install i3lock xclip ixappearance flameshot xfce4-power-manager nitrogen && wget -qO- https://git.io/papirus-icon-theme-install | sh`

Those are the apps ypu would use for stuff like screenshot, displaying battery etc. 

You schould run nitrogen and select the wallpaper you want. Then you schould reboot, select your profile and search for the settings. They schould be somewhere on the screen, then you schould select awesome. After you boot you schould see this.

And that is pretty much it. You really schould dig a bit in config files and do some tweaks or find out how does everything work but if you just want to use in press super+f1 and read what each key does.
